            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I've got a number of interests that I'll briefly touch upon here.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Theatre
                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                        <li>
                            Been a big fan of musical and non-musical theatre since the start of high school. So far I've
                            been in a production of Macbeth as King Duncan, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat
                            as Judah, and am currently acting as Tom Buchanon in UWO's production of the Great Gatsby.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Music
                    <ul style ="list-style-type:disc">
                        <li>
                            Perhaps not surprisingly, music has always been a massive part of my life. I love singing,
                            listening to music, and especially seeing it live. A number of my favourite artists are The
                            Strokes, the Smiths, Bowie, Gorillaz, Beatles, etc. etc... I could list names forever.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h2>Career Interests</h2>
            <p>
                It's no surprise that I'm interested in web development. I never expected that it'd be something I'd end
                up in, but seemingly every opportunity in my life has been pushing me more and more towards it, ha!
                Funny how things work out that way. But between my comp-sci teacher having me lead a club for two years,
                having a Co-op in the field, and now getting to work with this fantastic team, I've picked up more than
                a passing interest.
                <br>
                Aside from that, I've always had dreams of developing Operating Systems. I messed around with them a lot
                as a child, initially testing out a bunch on VMWare to test viruses that I found people testing
                on Youtube. My love for OS' really started when I got into Linux, however, and started spending
                hours tinkering with it and trying to tailor my computer exactly to my needs. I was just fascinated with
                low level the programming could get, and I feel like it's one of the fields where you *really* have
                to know the theory of everything on top of having the skill (something I value, given how my brain
                understands things).
                Of course, this could be a pipe dream. I can't say I've taken an operating systems class yet, and for
                all I know I might find it a complete bore!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Goal for this year</h2>
            <p>
                Over the past three or so years of my life, I've picked up a lot of scattered bits and pieces of web-dev
                knowledge. I've learnt a bit about mySQL, some PHP, some Node.JS, some html, some system administrations...
                many things, really, but I've never actually had a cohesive understanding of *all* of these at any
                given time. Every opportunity I got just happened to require I learn something new, and given that looming
                uni admissions meant I couldn't focus all my time into web development, I'd inevitably forget what I learnt previously.
                So I think my main goal this year is to finally get that cohesion I need to become a great web developer.
                I want to connect those many bits and pieces I have in my brain so that I can finally feel confident
                in my own skills.
